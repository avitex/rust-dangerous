//! Error support.
//!
//! - If you want the fastest error which has no debugging information,
//!   [`Invalid`] has you covered.
//! - If you want an error that is still designed to be fast, but also includes
//!   debugging information, [`Expected`] will meet your uh, expectations... If
//!   the feature `full-context` is enabled, [`Expected`] uses
//!   [`FullContextStack`], [`RootContextStack`] if not.
//! - If you require more verbosity, consider creating custom [`Context`]s
//!   before jumping to custom errors. If you do require a custom error,
//!   implementing it is easy enough. Just implement [`FromContext`] and
//!   [`From`] for [`ExpectedValue`], [`ExpectedLength`] and [`ExpectedValid`]
//!   and you'll be on your merry way. Additionally implement [`Details`] to
//!   support lovely error printing and [`ToRetryRequirement`] and [`IntoFatal`]
//!   for streaming protocols.
//!
//! Most of what `dangerous` supports out of the box is good to go. If you need
//! to stretch out performance more, or provide additional functionality on what
//! is provided, the error system should be flexible for those requirements. If
//! it's not, consider opening an issue.
